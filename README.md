(work in progress)

# What?

A simple browser widget that lets you enter in a series of time amounts (hours, minutes, seconds), and automatically calculates the total for you.

Eventually, it'll also calculate a more realistic "total time required", depending on your desired length of work sessions and factoring in short breaks. (Dear Pomodoro method: I'd be completely lost without you. üòç)

# Why?

A lot of the learning I do these days is online, especially when picking up a new programming language or framework, or studying for a certification.

Online learning is great. But some of these courses are *long*. It's nice how things tend to be split up into bite-sized chunks. However, when faced with dozens of videos to get through, sometimes I just want to know how long it's going to take me to reach the finish line. If that sounds familiar, this widget is for you too.

# How?
